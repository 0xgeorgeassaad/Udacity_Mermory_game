# Memory Game Project

A [Udacity](www.udacity.com) project developed using HTMl, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
## How to play:
The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
 The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
 If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
 If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
 The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
